# First post!

Since I have successfully survived my first year of grad school, I've decided to start blogging while working on my various
projects. I'm doing this to: (1) share what I'm working on (instead of just tweeting), (2) learn by _attempting_ to write instructive blog posts, and (3) because multiple people keep telling me this is a good idea... we'll find out.

Hopefully you'll find my posts useful and educational, as I'll be providing `R` code thanks to the incredible `blogdown` package by Yihui Xie ([more info here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)). I'll also be posting here any substantial updates made to the [`nflscrapR`](https://github.com/maksimhorowitz/nflscrapR) and [`nflWAR`](https://github.com/ryurko/nflWAR) packages (HINT: there will be several this summer).

Yes, there will be sports posts - but there will be plenty of non-sports posts related to projects I'm working on like clustering, multilevel models, copulas, and various programming exercises. [NIMBLE anyone?](https://r-nimble.org/)

Also I'm hoping to keep receiving feedback on what I'm working on and any post I write. As the number of posts I write goes up, the probability I write something completely wrong approaches one - so don't hesitate to correct me! Feel free to reach out to me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/Stat_Ron) or email, [contact info here](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryurko/).

Stay tuned for more!
