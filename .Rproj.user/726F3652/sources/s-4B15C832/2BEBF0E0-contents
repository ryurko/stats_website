# Welcome!

Hosted by the [CMU Statistics \& Data Science Department](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/) and [Carnegie Mellon Sports Analytics Club](https://www.cmusportsanalytics.com/), the [Carnegie Mellon University Baseball Analytics Workshop](https://cmusportsanalytics.com/workshop.html) is an interactive workshop focusing on data exploration skills with baseball data!

# Intro to Exploring Baseball Data with R

The starter code script for the first of the workshop, using `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to explore historical baseball data from the `Lahman` package is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/Carnegie-Mellon-Baseball-Analytics-Workshop/master/introduction_to_r_baseball.R).

# PITCHf/x and Statcast Resources

The starter code script for the second half of the workshop, dedicated to using PITCHf/x and Statcast data for creating a game plan for the Pirates against the Reds, is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryurko/Carnegie-Mellon-Baseball-Analytics-Workshop/master/game_plan_code.R).

Additional resources that will be useful for working with this data include:

+ [PITCHf/x](https://fastballs.wordpress.com/2007/08/02/glossary-of-the-gameday-pitch-fields/) and [Statcast](https://www.fangraphs.com/tht/research-notebook-new-format-for-statcast-data-export-at-baseball-savant/) glossary
+ [Pitch type information](https://www.fangraphs.com/library/pitch-type-abbreviations-classifications/)
+ [Jim Albert's blog: Exploring Baseball Data with R](https://baseballwithr.wordpress.com/)
+ [Bill Petti's `baseballr` package](http://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/)
+ [Carson Sievert's `pitchRx` package](http://pitchrx.cpsievert.me/)

The repository for all of the workshop's material is located [here](https://ryurko.github.io/Carnegie-Mellon-Baseball-Analytics-Workshop/).

All PITCHf/x and Statcast data, made available by [MLBAM](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/), was accessed using the `baseballr` package.
